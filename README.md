1. Introduction
1.1 Overview
The Garbage Management Plan is a complete guideline which comprises of a written
procedure for collecting, storing, processing, and disposing of garbage generated onboard
ship as per regulations.
Smart cities integrate multiple mobile or web solutions to build a comfortable human
habitation. One of these solutions is to provide an environmentally friendly, efficient and
effective garbage management system.
The current garbage collection system includes routine garbage trucks doing rounds daily or
weekly, which not only doesn’t cover every zone of the city but is a completely inefficient
use of government resources.
We propose a cost-effective mobile or web based system to utilize available resources to
efficiently manage the overwhelming amounts of garbage collected each day, while also
providing a better solution for the inconvenience of garbage disposal for the citizens.
A web based application is developed for the admins and the citizens, which primarily
provides the pick up services for the citizens.
1.2 Existing System
Employees heading for their workstations every morning. For all those people, there are just
not enough garbage bins available. On the streets of urban cities, hundreds of people are
passing the same location around one minute.
The obvious solution to this is for the cleaning staff to stay near garbage bins every day till
they fill up to clean them. This is not a real solution.
There are some notable negative effects when considering the garbage bins always being
full. One of the main effects is the surrounding area starting to smell and be very unpleasant.
When the garbage bins are full, people put their trash on sides of the garbage bins.
Workers head towards the streets every day to collect garbage but they have to collect all
types of garbage present at a location which is also not an efficient way.
1.3 Proposed System
Solid waste management can be broadly categorized as segregation, collection, and
transportation.
People can request for a pickup to collect various types of garbage in their region.
The server will collect the data and store them in a database. This data will be analyzed and
displayed on a different dashboard that can be accessed by the admins.
Based on the data collected, garbage trucks can be given routes according on the details
provided to efficiently route through all necessary garbage bins and finally reach the
dumping site.
Admins can monitor and can resolve the queries in an efficient way.
One of the primary advantage is that time management can be done accordingly and can
keep the areas in our city clean.
